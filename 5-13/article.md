The government should always care about people's lives.
It's important to use it's money properly so as to maintain order in the places that they are in charge of and to increase the happiness level of the inhabitants whom it's meant for.
To do so, the society would run better.
So should they spend money on entertainment or art facilities?
In my opinion, entertainment facilities here is much more significant than art ones.

On one hand, entertainment is more popular to the general public for the activities which are easier to take part in.
Art doesn't fit most people nowadays because of their heavy workload.
Spending time learning art stuffs simply makes it worse.
Art is important indeed, for it's the core of human civilization.
But art is elusive, entertainment is what most of us need most.

On the other hand, entertainment facilities are often more economically beneficial than those of art, enabling the authority to provide more services by the extra money made from them.
Entertainment facilities, such as stadiums, courts, tracks, fileds and parks, require you to pay to enter.
However, art facilities don't, thus there're still a number of people visiting it rarely -- they don't want to pay.
This is another evidence to prove that entertainment facilities are more attractive.

From that we can draw a conclusion--entertainment facilities are better than art ones in most cases.
I'll give my vote to entertainment.

Learning and practising never exist alone, they are tightly bound to each other. Therefore, many school teachers assign homework to students every day, this, however, sometimes give students big pressure. So it's necessary to strike a balance between enough practise and acceptable workload. As far as I'm concerned, to achieve that, the homework shouldn't be assigned every single day.

Firstly, the purpose of homework is to force students to put what they've just learnt on practis. Leaving homework every day just make students feel dull.
