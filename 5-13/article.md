The government should always care about people's lives.
So it's important to use their money properly, so as to maintain order and the happiness level in the places that they are in charge of.
If so, it will do good to the society, making it runs better.
So should they spend money on entertainment or art facilities? In my opinion, entertainment here is much more significant than art.

On one hand, entertainment is more popular to the general public for the activiries of whose are easier to take part in.
Art doesn't fit most people nowadays, because of the heavy workload. Spending time learning art stuffs simply make it worse.
Art is important indeed, for it's the core of human civilistion.
But entertainment is what most of us need most.

On the other hand, entertainment facilities are often more beneficial than art ones, which enables the official to provide more services. Entertainment facilities, such as sports ones, parks, they need you to buy a ticket to enter it. However, art facilities doesn't, thus there's still a number of people visit it occasionally -- they don't want to pay. This is another envidence to prove that enter facilities are more attractive.

From that we can draw a conclusion--entertainment facilities are better than art ones in most cases. I'll give my vote to entertainment.

Learning and practising never exist alone, they are tightly bound to each other. Therefore, many school teachers assign homework to students every day, this, however, sometimes give students big pressure. So it's necessary to strike a balance between enough practise and acceptable workload. As far as I'm concerned, to achieve that, the homework shouldn't be assigned every single day.

Firstly, the purpose of homework is to force students to put what they've just learnt on practis. Leaving homework every day just make students feel dull.
