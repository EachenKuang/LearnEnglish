Whether young adults should stay with their parents or leave them alone to become independent remains a big question .
I prefer the second one, the reasons are as follows :

First and foremost, according to some research, Chinese children nowadays are too dependent on their parents.
This is not a positive phenomenon, for the reason that we're all going to face the day that our parents stop working .
They'll all retire quickly after we become adults, and stop bringing home the bacon after that .
Arrive with their retirement, we'll take their job before their money runs out .
That is to say, we have to practice our living skills, to adopt this society, to become mature, become acknowledge, become powerful .
And after that, our parents would start to rely on us, we should prepare to become dependable .

Secondly, there's something between us and our parents -- the generation gap .
This always creates misunderstandings among generations, and sometimes we even have cultural shock -- because we have grown in different environment .
For instance, once my mum say, I should read more about politics, but everything I was thinking than was all about artificial intelligence .
This sounds difficult, we've been arguing for this meaningless topic for long, it's all waste of time .
Living with those who have generation gap among us with cause lots of problems in our daily life, and it's strongly recommended for us to separate from them, in order to prevent these problems from causing arguments and frustration .

Last but not least, we'll probably go to colleges or offices located in different cities, province, or even different countries .
We should go where we should stay, but keep sticking with our parents .

From that we can draw a conclusion -- it's better for young adults to leave their parents, as far as I'm concerned .
