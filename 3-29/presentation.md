## Ideal job

Whether a job can be called an ideal one really depends.

For me, **Computer Scientist** is the best job.
Here're several reasons as follows:

+ First but foremost, it's my interest. I love Computer Science,
it's an amazing subject where you can do research on the purest academic problems,
and find the most elegant solutions corresponds to the problems.
It's the world of logic,
no complex relationship, no dishonesty, no bureaucracy.
+ Secondly, It's easy for a Computer Scientist to find a well-paid job.
Here's a lack of Programmers in the society nowadays,
so no worry about job hunting.
+ Last but not least, Programmers interact with computers everyday,
instead of those trouble makers, stupid guys, etc.

I'd like to work in a city,
because it's convenient,
you can buy things you need in a shop
near your living place,
going there by foot.

But it really depends on the boss,
or the administration system.
