```
Some people like to travel with a companion.
Other people prefer to travel alone.
Which do you prefer?

> Travelling sometimes brings you loneliness.
Someone take companions in to against that, and the others just simply enjoy travelling alone.
I prefer travelling alone, making my travelling more flexible.
You have care about your companion, which you don't need to when travelling alone.
