Travelling provides access to brand new cultures or interesting
stories. It's an essential way for people to relax themselves. Apparently,
there're several aspects that affect the travelling experience. In most
cases, we talk about who to travel with, what to eat or drink, and where to
go. In my opinion, the best travelling experiences are mostly contributed
by good places rather than the other two factors.

Food actually has the least impact on travelling experience
from my point of view. I've been to Britain once. Britain
is a nation notorious for its terrible food. I tried British food, it's indeed,
not delicious at all. But the food didn't depress me. I still enjoy the
tour. Food is but people's energy supply, and it doesn't affect them mentally.
Traveling matters in people's sensory pleasure. So as far as I'm concerned,
food doesn't play a significant role in the traveling experience.

With the development of internet technology, we can
contact our friends without any blockage. Which means, if someone
visit some cities alone, he can also talk to his friends just in time.
Furthermore, anybody around me will bother me when I'm trying to appreciate
the wonderful scene. Such emotional interaction with nature is valuable
enough for anyone to enjoy alone.

Places are the most important parts of an enjoyable travelling.
In fact, people visit somewhere just for its beautiful natural scene and
marvelous buildings. When I was a junior high student, I went to Florence,
Italy. It's the most flourishing city during the Renaissance. All these masterpieces, such as the buildings,
paintings, make me feel i was at that time shoulder by shoulder with those great people.
It's the final target of travelling. I can say, I travel just for those wonderful places.

From those reasons we can draw a conslusion, where to go makes the biggest contributions
to an enjoyable tour. What to eat and who to travel with doesn't matter as much as places.
If there's no beautiful scenery, a travelling doesn't make sense.
