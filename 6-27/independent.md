Travelling provides the access to brand new culture or interesting
stories. It's an essential way for people to relax themselves. Apperantly,
there're several aspects that affect the travelling experience. In most
cases, we talk about who to travel with, what to eat or drink, and where to
go. In my opinion, the best travelling experiences are mostly contributed
by good places rather than the other two factors.

Firstly, food. This actually has the least impact on travelling experience
from my point of view. I've been to Britain, once three years ago. Britain
is a nation famous for its terrible food. I tried British food, it's indeed,
not delicious at all. But the food didn't depressed me. I still enjoy the
tour. Food is but people's energy supply, it doesn't affect them mentally.

Secondly, friends. With the development of internet technology, we can
contact with our friends without any blockage. Which means, if someone
visit some cities alone, they can also talk to their friends just-in-time.
Also, anybody around me will bother me when I'm trying to feel the
wonderful scene. Such emotional interaction with nature is valuable enough
for anyone to enjoy alone.

Finally, places. It's the most important part of an enjoyable travelling.
In fact, people visit somewhere just for its beautiful natural scene and
marvelous buildings. When I was a junior high student, I went to Florence,
Italy. It's the most flourishing city during the Renaissance. The buildings,
paintings, all these masterpieces make me feel like those great people were
just in front of me. It's the final target of travelling. I can say, I
travel just for those wonderful places.

From those reasons we can draw a conslusion, where to go mainly contributes
to an enjoyable tour. Without food or friends, I can still enjoy myself. But
if there's no beautiful scenery, a travelling can't be a travelling.
