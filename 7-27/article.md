The speech "Beyond Vietnam" hold by Martin Luther King, a household name, effectively builds the
argument that it's unjust of USA to take part in the Vietnam War. By claiming the success of the
struggle that he had been waged few years ago and his own experience in the ghettoes in the last
three years, the miserable scene of the poor in USA is clearly illustrated. Three points are used
in his speech.

In paragraph 2, Martin's argument that the war's actually destroying the hopes of the poor at that
time. The war, demanding a number of sodiers, is the greatest killer, and the poor women's sons,
brothers and husbands would be the direct victims. They were sent to the front line, and get
killed. Martin illustrates lots of imaginary scenes that might happen in the future if USA don't
stop participating in the Vietnam's war, and concluded the behavior of sending the poor to the war
as a `cruel manipulation`of them.

Also, the 3rd paragraph, where his experience in the ghettoes is used, states that the oppressed
are actually the poor in USA. Amereica is trying to stop the violence of Vietnam, but Amereica
itself is using violence, too. Using violence to fight against violence is another unreasonable
aspect of the USA's participation. Martin describes the people living in the ghettoes and tells
his feeling when he walk through them, bringing credibility to his discussion. The vivid picture
touches the audience's and my hearts, giving the best persuasion that USA's injustice.

In the end, Martin gives the idea that people shouldn't limit their vision to the black. More
people, apart from the black, are under a poor condition. Martin uses quotations in the SCLC
and a question raised to him to establish his authority on human rights and his just aim --
prevent the lives of the poor to be devastated. To save those people, USA shouldn't involve
the Vietnam's war.
