The reading and the listening mainly talk about a way dealing with the damaged
trees produced by forest fires and large storms in the northwestern United
States. The passage holds the opinion that people should use salvage logging,
while the lecture disagree with such solution.

First, the article claims that dead trees are difficult to decompose, which is
a blockage for new trees to grow. However, the professor states that the dead
trees are actually rewarding for new trees. The process of decomposing provides
necessary nutrients for new trees to grow.

Second, the text comes up with the idea that dead trees will attract insects
which are harmful to the forest, like spruce bark beetle. In contrast, the
speech falsified this idea by asserting that there're more insects that can
factually help the growing of the trees. According to a survey, the beetles
have lived in a forest for about hundreds of years.

Finally, the reading states that cutting those trees down can bring some
commercial benifits and job opportunities. On the other hand, The lecturer
claims that such advantages are temporary. Long-term considered, it will lead
to more problems.
