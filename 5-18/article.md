## Read Book

In order to store and spread their thoughts, fantasies and stories,
our ancestors had invented something called 'book'.
That is to say, the original usage of 'book' is to record something,
and make it easy to be read by others.
But recently, someone said that 'we should only read books about truths and real people'.
This idea is very seriously wrong, I'll give my reasons as follows.

> Some only read books about real people and stories, while others don't have such preference.
> And for me, I'll give my vote to the latter.

First there's always something that cannot be mentioned explicitly,
due to some political reasons.
So as the author of a book, if you want to say something sensitive,
you have to use an approach called 'metaphor',

which is known as representing truths by unreal stories.
For instance, Lu Xun, an extremely influential writer in China,
has written a lot of unreal stories to
reflect the dark sides of the Chinese society.
This is the method he used to save China.
The ones who only appreciate the so-called 'real stories'
just miss these kinds of information.

> They will not realize the

> Something that has a potential to irritate the government.
> Politically sensitive.

Secondly, making stories up can better express humanity than simply
telling the truth. Sometimes the real world is boring, and you
need to adapt it, in order to improve the dramatic effects.
This is a useful way to make your stories more attractive,
and that can drive more people to read it.
Sticking <!-- on --> to 'true' stories doesn't make any sense.

Limiting oneself on stories that really happen is really stupid.
It just stop you from getting more information and knowledges.
There's no good of that. This theory also works with movies,
cartoons, or TV series. In fact, we need more adaptation and
metaphor, to bring the stories soul and give them lives.
