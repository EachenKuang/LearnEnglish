## 一个产品是打广告好还是不打广告好

In addition, there never is a product that is well-known in the beginning.
Without an advertisment, how could anyone know the existense of your product?
If a product is good enough, though, it could be popular by the users' spread.
But there's a demand of quite a lot of initial users, which you can easily make by advertising.

## Read Book

In order to store and spread their thoughts, fantasies and stories,
our ancestors has invented something called 'book'.
That is to say, the original usage of 'book' is to record something, and make it easy to be read by others.
But recently, someone said that 'we should only read books about truths and real people'.
This idea is very seriously wrong, I'll give my reason as follows.

First there's always something that cannot be mentioned explicitly, due to some politital reasons.
So as the author of a book, if you want to say something that are sensitive, you have to use an approach
called 'metaphor', which is known as representing truths by unreal stories.
For instance, Lu Xun, an extremely influential writter in China, has writter a lot of unreal stories to
reflect the dark side of the Chinese society. This is the method he used to save China.
The ones who accept the so-called 'real stories' just miss these information.

Secondly, making stories up can better express humanity than simply telling the truth.
Sometimes the real world is boring, and you need to adapt it, in order to improve the dramatic effects.
This is a useful way to make your stories more attractive,
and that can drive more people to read it.
Sticking on 'true' stories doesn't make any sense.

Limiting oneself on stories that really happen is really stupid. It just stop you from getting more
information and knowledges. There's no good of that. This theory also works with movies, catoons,
or TV series. In fact, we need more adaption and metaphor, to bring the stories soul and give them lives.
