## paragraph
In addition, most high school students do not have any notions about working in a company or living in the society. A gap year of vacation or working could help them be familiar with those stuffs. In this case, no other personal experience can best illustrate such merits than the following one. I have a brother named Van, after high school he became a bookworm, caring about nothing but test. His parents forced him to take a gap year before entering the college. At first, he was reluctant to do so, thinking such action was useless for his future development. But after he came back from his gap year, he became more talkative and knowledgable. And he told me the things he has experienced in the gap year was really beneficial for his college studying. And thus from the example above, I'm truely for the idea of taking a gap year.

## active restful

Once upon a time, I met a doctor who had been said to had saved more than a hundred people's lives.
We discussed about the infuence of health given by habits, the most impressive opinion he gave me is that active people always have some quiet hobby, while the restful guys have some lively ones.
It appears to be a strage statement, but when I tried thinking of people around me, it works magically, every single time.

Energetic people always do his or her best to talk or move because they want to, but it really takes a lot of vim. It's tiring. In order to reduce the tiredness, they should have some restful habits, such as reading books, listening to the music, writing, etc. A friend of mine, Victor, is an active guy. Every time I come to see him, he has endless stories to tell me and activities to do. But only some close friends knows how's he like when he is alone -- as quiet as a sculpture. His behavior perfectly matches the doctor's opinion!

The human culture is established based on communications. Nobody can live alone, silently, without interacting with anyone else. There's quite a lot of people around me, who doesn't talk a lot or move a lot, say, vert restful. But they're not like that all the time. One of my English teacher, Mr. Gao, seem to be a gentle and quiet man. He has never been angry, however terrible I got in my exam. But when I added him as a friend on WeChat, I took at his 'friend circle', I was shocked -- the language he used, the photos he posted, everything made him look like a completely different man. He goes swimming, singing with his friends, playing games, go travelling. What a discovery! Mr. Gao 's story also proved the doctor's statement.

What the doctor said seems to be weird, but it never fails with anyone. Every coin has two sides. I totally agree with his idea, that restful guys sometimes active, while the active ones always have an inactive habits.
