## paragraph

In addition, most high school students do not have any notions about working in a company or living in the society. A gap year of vacation or working could help them be familiar with those stuffs. In this case, no other personal experience can best illustrate such merits than the following one. I have a brother named Van, after high school he became a bookworm, caring about nothing but test. His parents forced him to take a gap year before entering the college. At first, he was reluctant to do so, thinking such action was useless for his future development. But after he came back from his gap year, he became more talkative and knowledgable. And he told me the things he has experienced in the gap year was really beneficial for his college studying. And thus from the example above, I'm truely for the idea of taking a gap year.

Once upon a time, I met a doctor who had been said to had saved more than a hundred people's lives.
We discussed about the infuence of health given by habits, the most impressive opinion he gave me is that active people always have some quiet hobby, while the restful guys have some lively ones.
It appears to be a strage statement, but when I tried thinking of people around me, it works magically, every single time.

Energetic people always do his or her best to talk or move because they want to. This really takes a lot of vim.
