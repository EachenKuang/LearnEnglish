The article and the speech mainly discuss the cause of the sea otters' rapid declination.
According to the article, the sea otters are killed by environmental pollution, while
the lecture supports the idea that the otters are eaten by predators. Both of them come
up with 3 points.

Frist, the article mentions that we know how industrial chemical stuffs pollut the sea,
and the water sample supports this idea. But the professor states that we actually haven't
seen any dead otters washed onto the coasts. If they're killed by pollution, their dead
body will be kept and washed onto the beach. But if they're eaten by predators, there
won't be any dead body, which is exactly what we see now.

Second, the text claims that there're some other sea mammals are also declining,
indicating that the cause of this declination also affects on other animals as well, which
proves its point again. In contrast, the lecturer mentions human hunters, because only
smaller sea mammals are declining, and human hunters cannot hunt larger animals. In this
way, the lecture has falsificate the reading again.

Last, the passage states that the pollution hypothesis can also explain the uneven way of
this declination: [it's diversed by different locations]. Pollutions can only affect where
accessible, which matches the evidence. But the professor says the predators can only
access certain places too. So the predator hypothesis can also be proved by this evidence.

<!-- Students do reading by their own personally is as important as, or more important -->
<!-- than reading assigned by teachers -->

Reading is an essential way for people to gain knowledge. What kind of book brings what
kind of knowledge. Sometimes we're assigned by teachers or professors to read some book,
while in the rest of time we decide books to read according to our interests. So here's
the problem: how important are those books chose by ourselves? Equals to the assigned
ones, or more important? In my opinion, my own decisions always have the superiority.

First, I know myself better than my teachers. I know what sorts of knowledge I lack. I
know myself better than any other people in the world, so my choices of books are more
significant. I have such experience when I was learning computer science at university.
I wanted to read more about parsing technique, but the professor simply assigned me to
read lots of books about compiler backends, which I was very familiar with at that time.
The professor's assignments really wasted a lot of time that I originally decided to
spend on something more meaningful. So, although it's necessary to follow the teachers'
orders, I consider it less significant than my own choices, because I can choose books
more suitable to myself than my teachers.

Second, the school works are only a part of our life, we should consider more about
what we really interested in. For example, I have to learn physics before graduating.
during this period of time, I'll be asked to read some physics books, due to my
teachers' assignments. But that will finally come to an end, and I probably won't touch
them anymore in the rest of my life. Considering the future life, the books that we
Choose by our own personally has the priority.

From that we can draw a conclusion, books chose by ourselves are more significant than
ones assigned by teachers.
