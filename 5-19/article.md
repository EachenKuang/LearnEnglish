The 21st century is the century of Internet. We've already seen how the Internet can affect on our daily life -- online paying, Facebook and Twitter, GitHub and StackOverflow, Youtube and Amazon, etc.
The Internet can do exactly the same thing in the area of education.
Education would become much easier if combined with Internet.
Reading books is such a limited way to aquire knowledge, for the reason that you can only read about what's on the book.
In the case of Internet, you can strike a balance among various kinds of opinions, while is much better than you can gain from reading.

By reading scientific books, we can be informed of many facts;
by reading geography, we know the earth surface, forms, physical features and so on;
bt reading history, we are told of the growth of te nations.

If you're so busy, you must feel very exhausted.
Is there anyone who wants to work more when he or she is already very
tired?
The answer is obviously no.
From that we can tell, he tends to go to a restaurant -- he just has to eat what he wants by paying for it.
He don't need to go to the supermarket, neither does he have the necessity to wash the meat and vegatables nor to wash the dishes.
To save all the efforts to do something else more meaningful,
I assume a sensible person should eat out rather than in.

Internet is obviously indispensable in our daily lives --
it's widely used and easy to access.
I am a software engineer,
without Internet I cannot search for solutions to the problems or the compiling toolchains.
My work is totally based on Internet,
and there're software developers all around the world.
Imagine the Internet vanished,
then the Internet industry in the world will be eliminated too,
which is a big retrogress in human's civilization.
After that, a large number of people whose jobs are relavant to Internet will fall into a paradox.
So for me and every other software engineers in the world,
Internet is our blood.
