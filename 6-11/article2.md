ability to plan and organize -->

With the development of technology, people's lives nowadays are getting more and
more complicated. This tendency affects the education. Some educators consider it
essential to learn the young people the ability to plan and organize, in order to
manage their life better in the complex modern world. I agree with their idea.

First, young people will eventually live alone, but it takes time to learn how to
plan and organize themselves. To ensure that they're ready to live alone, they
should learn the skills in advance. That is to say, they should have the ability
when they're young. Or one day, they'll get into the worst situation when
solving with some life problems like purchasing a house or a car, making arrangement
for a party or a meeting, or even managing their basic life. To live a stable and
happy life, the young should really have the ability to plan and organize.

Second, such abilities have other benifits. The ability to organize is actually what
we call "leadership". People get more intelligent and more rational when practising
their leadership, which means that such abilities have extra effects. I was a club
leader in my high school. During my term, I faced lots of difficulties. I built up a
sense of organizing and making plans effectively in that period of time, and I feel
I am smarter when doing something irrelavent like playing soccer and doing computer
science homework. Actually, I improved my sense of logical thinking too.

From that we can draw a conclusion: it's essential for the youngsters to have the
ability of planning and organizing. such abilities help not only with arranging
something or managing something, but also help with irrelavent areas which need a
sense of logic.
