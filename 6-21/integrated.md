The lecture and the reading talk about a discovery of ancient jars that are supposed
to be batteries. The reading states that such hypothesis is wrong -- ancient people
can't have been used such jars as batteries, while the professor holds an opposite
idea.

First, the reading claims that there're no conductors (like metal wires) attached to
those jars. But the lecturer argues that these jars are discovered by local people,
who don't have relevant experience, they might have found such conductors, but
haven't awared of the importance of them. So the conductors might be ignored or even
thrown away. According to the lecture's idea, the reading's opinion is wrong.

Second, the article says that the jars might be used for holding scrolls of sacred
texts instead of power supply, because the copper cylinders are likely to be discovered
from a nearby city. But the professor disagreed by stating that they might be
originally used for something else but eventually people found they're abled to
generate electricity. So it is possible that the jars are real ancient batteries.

Finally, the writer claims that ancient people don't need electricity. In contrast,
the lecture gives the opinion that although ancient people don't have electrical
devices, the batteries still can be used for other target such as showing invisible
magic power, stimulating muscles, healing illed people, or punishing the criminals.
In this way, the passage's idea is falsified again.
