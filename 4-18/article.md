## About soccer

Soccer is an awesome sort of sport no matter what aspect you're concerned about.
The reasons are as follows, backed by lots of examples around me myself:

Firstly, It's no doubt that we generally want to build up muscles.
Playing soccer needs strength, and you'll be force to run fast and move quickly.
In that way, you'll keep shape and become more muscular.
The fastest boy in my class who gained three champions in the sports
meeting is a soccer lover.

Secondly, it's such pleasure to have friends. Imagine lives without friends' existence.
A soccer game involves quite a lot players, which brings you friendship.
It's very pure friendship, without money, without power, it's just fun.
Actually, the first time when I met my best friend, we're playing soccer against each other.

Thirdly, outdoors exercises have got some advantages in common, which soccer have as well,
is that you can touch the nature in a short distance.

From that we can draw a conclusion that soccer is a good kind of sport anyway.
I love soccer, which makes me proud of that.
