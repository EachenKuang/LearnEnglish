## 父母是否是孩子最好的老师

In addition, children learn about the world since they could feel the world.
Parents are the first people that they have interact and communicate with.
That is to say 

## 公共交通是否应该收钱

In addition, in order to improve our life quality and ease
the traffic jam, the government requires a substantial amount
of money to provide us more public transport tools such as buses,
MRTs, and subways. What's more, the fees of riding are so low
that most of them are less than two yuan. For example, a bus can
cost millions of RMBs and the maintenance fees are also extravagant,
while its annual incomes are less than 1 million. There's no necessity
for the commoners to concern about the financial burden of such fees
which are, however, insufficient to provide the qualified service.
Thus it's very reasonable for the government to charge fees in this term.

## 人们是否能从体育活动或者社交活动中交到真朋友

In addition, people are sincere when doing what they like.
They don't have to concern about anything related to money
that in most cases spoil the relationships. In such period of
time, people expose their inner selves to each other. Let's suppose a
situation where a number of people gather together to do sports
or engage in other kinds of social activities where they interact
and communicate with each other, they can find the kind of people
that they really appreciate. Isn't it the best way to meet 'real' friends?

spontaneously 自发的

have the same hobbies or appreciation

Which is a basis for a solid friendship.

In these activities, all their feelings are true and they're honest with each other.

All these factors constitute a cornerstone in building a faithful friendship.

## 人们是否应该只和真朋友打交道

In addition, there're a large number of situations where you have to communicate
with people for money, career and your families and you're bound to feel
uncomfortable but you cannot avoid. Real friends can understand your inner self,
and you're happy when you're with them. But as a social member, everyone needs
money and power which true friends cannot bring you in most cases. We're
eager for love and friends which is our human nature, however, we also need
'bread' to survive. The reality is cruel, and it requires us to adapt to
various kinds of situations which, whether we're willing or not, have to
confront and deal with people we don't really like, such as having a workday
lunch with your boss and engaging in unfavorable social activities with your
colleagues. We require true friends to soothe our heart. We also have to get
along well with people who we're not really fond of to adjust to the society.

## 你喜欢吃快餐还是传统食物

In addition, it's easier to choose what to eat in a fast food restaurant,
for there're lots of fixed combinations of food so you have fewer choices
which means you're free of the worries of making them.
In the traditional food cafeterias, you'll confront with various kinds of
food that is very difficult to select one to have -- they all looked nice,
making the choices cost time there, which is not suitable in our fast-pace
society. What's more, fast foods are cheaper -- a hamburger only cost 17
RMBs with vegetables and meat in it, which is nutritious as well. In
contrast, traditional food with the same nutritious value will cost as
much as at least 30 RMBs in China! So for poor students like me, it's
factually wise to choose fast food rather than traditional ones out of
financial concern.

## 创新现在对企业来说不重要了，是否同意这个观点

In addition, the contemporary world is in the age of information
which is available to everyone, making the innovations easier and
easier, anyone is able to change the world by innovation, especially
for companies. Especially for small corporations, it’s essential for
them to come up with new ideas to survive in the increasingly
competitive market in case of being edged out. If they hold on to
their conventional products and never make adaptations to them, then
such products cannot satisfy the consumers who are more and more
demanding nowadays. And they will choose a more suitable one. In order
to maintain their customer base, companies must keep innovating.
