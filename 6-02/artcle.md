## Write and speak abilities

It's essential for people to express themselves, or the society cannot run. There're
several ways that one can express himself, like writing and speaking. But what's the
priority of these two methods? Someone said writing skills are more important than
speaking abilities, but in my opinion, speaking affects one more.

Firstly, with the help of internet, the lack of writing skills can be offset, while
speaking is more personal. One cannot get help when talking to others, but the can
when writing. I always ask my best friend to preview my English Email before sending
it out. He is an expert in English writing, I've learned a lot from him. He often
complain that he feels uncomfortable talking to others -- he doesn't have much time
to think while speaking to others but he does while writing.

Secondly, when a person meets someone else, which is the occasion that people give
first impression to each other, he uses the skill of speaking. First impression is
so important that speaking becomes important too. People who can talk proper and, in
some cases, humorously, will probably be considered to be well-educated or learned.
Sometimes benefits will come to him as a consequence. A friend of mine has once told
me the significance of speaking. He was at a meeting, while an old man pass by them.
The old man asked about the way out and my friend answered with polite words showing
his respectful. The old man became interested in him and asked a series of question,
my friend answered as well. After that he get a high salary job and he's still there.
"If I showed less knowledge I won't get this job so easy. I was just worry about a
work at that time. It's really an unforgettable experience.

From the experiences of those two friends of mine we can draw a conclusion: although
writing is an essential skill of everybody, it may not be as significant as speaking.
