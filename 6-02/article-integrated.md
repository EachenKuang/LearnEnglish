## About the sao writer

The lecture and the reading mainly discuss about Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir and its
historical value. The lecture comes up with 3 points that are completely opposite to the
reading.

First, in the memoir, Chevalier talks about his experience living in Switzerland. He
claims that he was rich and worthy. The article was critical to this claim, it says that
he had borrowed a large sum of money from another Swiss worthy man, which is can
falsification to that content. But the lecture explained that his properties are mostly
golds and jewelry, it takes time to change them into real money, so he just borrowed
money from others temporarily.

Second, Chevalier talks about the conversation betweens him and the writer Voltaire.
The reading says he can't capture these conversation many years after they occurred,
but the lecture asserts that he remember every word in the conversations. By this way
the lecture contradicts the second opinion of the paragraph.

Last, Chevalier states that he had escaped the prison in Venice, and the article doesn't
agree because of the possibility that his friends could bribe the jailers. In contrast,
the lecture declared the truth that many other prisoners were richer than him (which
means they're more possibile to bribe the jailers) but they didn't get out. And the
government repaired the ceiling of the prison after he escaped, which can also prove the
truth.

In conclusion, according to the lecture, Chevalier's memoir is true.
