## About the sao writer

The lecture and the reading mainly discuss Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir and its
historical value. The lecturer comes up with 3 points to except its value, while the
reading is completely opposite.

First, in the memoir, Chevalier talks about his experience living in Switzerland. He
claims that he is rich and worthy. The critical article doutbts this claim, it says that
he borrowed a large sum of money from another Swiss worthy man, which is a [falsification]
to that content. But the professor explains that his properties are mostly golds and
jewelry, it takes time to change them into real money, so he just borrows money from
other people temporarily.

Second, Chevalier talks about the conversations between him and the writer Voltaire.
The reading says he can't capture these conversations many years after they occurred,
but the lecture asserts that he tried his best to write down the content of the
conversations after they occurred, so he can obviously tell the accurate words in his
memoir. [By this way the professor contradicts the second opinion of the passage].

Last, Chevalier states that he escaped the prison in Venice, and the article doesn't
agree because of the possibility that his friends bribe the jailers. In contrast, the
lecture declared the truth that many other prisoners were richer than him (which
means they're more possibile to bribe the jailers) but they doesn't get out. And the
government repaired the ceiling of the prison after he escaped, which can also prove the
truth.
