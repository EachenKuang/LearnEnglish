## About the sao writer

The lecture and the reading mainly discuss Chevalier de Seingalt's memoir and its
historical value. The lecturer comes up with 3 points to support its value, while
the reading is completely the opposite.

First, in the memoir, Chevalier talks about his experience living in Switzerland. He
claims that he is rich and wealthy. The article doutbts this claim, it says that he
borrows a large sum of money from another Swiss wealthy man, which a rich man is not
expected to do. But the professor explains that his properties are mostly golds and
jewelry, it takes time to change them into real money, so he just borrows money from
other people temporarily.

Second, Chevalier talks about the conversations between him and the writer Voltaire.
The reading says he can't capture these conversations many years after they occurred,
but the lecture asserts that he tries his best to write down the content of the
conversations after they occurred, so he can obviously tell the accurate words in his
memoir. [By this way the professor contradicts the second opinion of the passage].

Last, Chevalier states that he escapes the prison in Venice by breaking the ceiling
of the prison, and the article doesn't agree because of the possibility that his
friends bribe the jailers. In contrast, the lecture disclaims this possibility that
many other prisoners were richer than him (which means they're more possibile to
bribe the jailers) but they don't get out. And the government repairs the ceiling
of the prison after his [escapement], which is a strong proof of his statement.
