Learning is an essential part of human lives. We become abled to do everything by learning
how to do it. During this procedure, we might face some difficulties, like what to learn,
or how to learn. The learning environment is also important, we usually learn from others.
But here's the problem: someone think people learn faster and easier with themselves, or
colleagues, classmates, anyway with people of the same age, and someone holds the opposite
opinion. I support the former one.

First, talking to older people is harder than ones of the same age, which has a lot of things
to do with the generation gap. People feel less comfortable while interacting with older ones
due to some stereotype, but old habbits die hard, stereotype die even harder. People need to
be in a comfortable environment while learning, and that's why they learn faster and easier
with co-workers or friends. I have such a similar experience. Once I was a primary school
student, I was confused about why '1' isn't a prime number. My teacher had explained but I
still didn't understand. But when I asked my brother, I get his idea immediately. His
explanation is probably not better than my teacher's, but I was too nervous in front of the
teacher. That's truely a big blockage.

Secondly, people of the same age often .
