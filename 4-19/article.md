## About soccer

Soccer is an awesome sport no matter what aspect you're concerned about.
The reasons are as follows, backed by lots of examples around me myself:

Firstly, It's no doubt that everyone generally wants to build up body.
Playing soccer needs strength, and you'll be forced to run fast and move quickly.
In that way, you'll keep in a good shape and become more muscular.
The fastest boy in my class who gained three champions in the sports
meeting is a soccer lover.

Secondly, it's such a pleasure to have friends. Not one can imagine lives without friends.
A soccer game involves 11 players, which brings you friendship.
It's very pure friendship, without money, without power, it's just fun.
Actually, the first time when I met my best friend, we're playing soccer against each other.

Thirdly, outdoors exercises have got some advantages in common, which soccer have as well,
is that you can touch the nature in a short distance.

Last, Soccer game involves quite a bit lot of players(the number is not fixed), which highlights the power of team work. 
As known by everyone, team sports help us to discover a team spirit, this is also an important
reason why soccer lovers are always gathered together, but stay alone.
Soccer brings you friendship, and also warmness.

From that we can draw a conclusion that soccer is a good kind of sport anyway.
I love soccer, which makes me proud of that.
