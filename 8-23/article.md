The passage and the lecture mainly discuss the possible author of the beautifully handwritten
manuscript written in vellum discovered by Wilfreid M. Voynich. The writer comes up with three
possibilities with some reasons, and the lecturer falsifies those possibilities by some other
reasons.

First, the article mentions Anthony Ascham, a sixteen-century physician and botanist, because
the illustrations in the manuscript are quite similar to the those in his books on medicinal
plants. The professor contradict this possibility by providing the information that Ascham
doesn't need to take notes using mysterious symbols, because he doesn't origin knowledge.

Second, the text refers to Edward Kelley, another sixteen-century individual, whose job is to
extort from worthy people across Europe by pretending to have magical powers. This manuscript
can be created and sold by him as a book of magical secrets. The lecture claims that people
in sixteen-century are much easier to fool, so if Kelley want to created a so-called
"magic book", he doesn't need to use such complex symbols. This invalidate the article's guess.

Voynich himself is the last person mentioned by the passage, which comes up with the idea that
Voynich's discovery is actually a modern fake. The professor says that although the paper can
be faked, he doesn't have a way to get some 400-year-old ink. So he can't be the author of the
manuscript.
