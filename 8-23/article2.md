# Famouse people deserve more privacy

Deciding to become an famous individual means partially giving up the privacy --
social media will bother famous people every day, trying their best to know as
more about famous people's personal affairs as they can in order to extract money
from their fans. Recently someone come up with the idea that famous entertainers
or athletes deserve more privacy. Which is totally unreasonable to me.

First, losing privacy is one of the main disadvantages of being an idol -- because
showing themselves to the public is a significant way of gaining fans. This is what
famous people benefit from, why should they stop doing it? We can see super stars
take part in some TV programmes (whose contents are all about their private life)
to earn money and attract viewers. For example, the famous Chinese TV programme
"Daddy, where are we going?", involving lots of film stars and singers, is of an
extremely high audience rating. Do the participants care even a little about their
privacy? No.

Second, it's difficult for the famous people to keep privacy. The harder they try
to protect their privacy, the crazier the media will attempt to explor their private
life, because of the fans' strong curiosity. It is human nature to discover and
investigate interesting but unknown things, part of which are famous people.
