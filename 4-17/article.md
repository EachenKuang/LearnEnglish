## A guide to a happy life

Whether to become a laugher who laugh out loud every single day remains a big question,
from my point of view the answer to this question is obviously yes. The reasons are as follows:

First and foremost, laughing will make you feel better. According to a psychological research,
what you feel actually depends on what you behave. It's different from what we know as usual,
but that's true. It is said, if you don't run away immediately when you're facing a tiger,
you wouldn't feel fearful. Therefore, if you laugh, you'll feel happy then. So why not laugh?

Secondly, a laugher seems to be friendly and kind. It will leave a good impression to others.
Imagine a person laugh every day. You won't think he's a bad man anyway.

Last but not least, laughing will make a happy atmosphere, the happiness will spread,
and warm everyone.

Having read what I've written above, do you want you laugh right now?
