Charities are always considered to be something positive,
but someone says the ones help people are more important than ones help animals.

In my opinion, they're equaled, but this world is built by human, as well as the charities.
If there's no animals, we can still run charities for human,
but if there were no people,there wouldn't be any charities!
Further more, people have more oppotunities to die,
especially in wars. That is to say, people need more care.

But we should hold an opinion that everything borned equaled.
We couldn't simply tell that which species are more important.
This idea doesn't respect that.
If we hadn't protected animals, the ecosystem might have become out of balance, causing terrible problems.

From that we can draw a conclusion that this idea is partially correct, it sounds reasonable logically, but doesn't respect animals' rights.
