## About spending patterns 1

U.S. people spent different amount of money on different things.
According to a research, the spending patterns are completely
different between 1966 and 1996.

In 1966, people spent most on food -- it's of 44%. 
The thing after food are cars, whose consumption accounts for 23%.
The least one is computer, the proportion of which is approximately 1%,
and the rest of them(patrol, restaurants, furniture, books)
seem to be more regular -- from 6% \~ 10%.
From this we can tell, only very few people are able to buy
computers, and they're not so rich -- or they'll spend less on food.
