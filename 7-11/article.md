Almost everyone on earth should find a job, as a necessity in human lives. They have preference of jobs in common:
all of them want a stable one, and they want to success, too. Someone just said, such kind of jobs are easier to
be indentified in the past. As far as I am concerned, such point doesn't make any sense.
