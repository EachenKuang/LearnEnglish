+ Professor, welcome to the programme.

+ Thank you. Now I know people could be shocked to hear that the
moon landing never happened. So I'd like to show you some photos,
so you can understand my theories. Now look carefully at this first
photo. What do you notice, about the shadows of the astronauts?

+ They're pointing in different directions.

+ Exactly. Now, the light in this photo supposedly comes from the
sun. Therefore the shadow should be pointing in the same direction.
The fact the shadows pointing in different directions, means,
that there must be 2 light sources. Studio lights!

+ So you're saying these photos are taken in a studio?

+ Exactly. Because of the shadows, this photo must be a fake.

+ You can't be serious.

+ Well, look at the second photo. Where is the sun?

+ Behind the astronaut.

+ So, if the light is behind the astronaut, why is the front of him,
not in darkness? Why? Because they used the studio light, to shine
on the astronaut.

+ Aha.

+ Now look at the sky, in the background. What can you see?

+ Nothing.

+ Exactly. Where are the stars? This can't be a photo of the moon,
because there are no stars.

+ But why would the Americans want to do something like this?

+ Well, you have to remember the back in the 60s. The U.S. was in the
middle of the cold war with the Russians, it was very important for
both countries to show their advanced technology. Space travel was the
greatest challenge. The Russians was the first to put man in space,
in 1959. The U.S. needed to do something better. I believe, the American
government produced these photos, so that the world think they will win
in the race.

+ Thank you for your fascinating theories, professor.
