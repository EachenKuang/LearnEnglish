## 精听

+ Professor, welcome to the programme.

+ Thank you. Now I know people could be shocked to hear that the
moon landing never happened. So I'd like to show you some photos,
so you can understand my theories. Now look carefully at this first
photo. What do you notice, about the shadows of the astronauts?

+ They're pointing in different directions.

+ Exactly. Now, the light in this photo supposedly comes from the
sun. Therefore the shadow should be pointing in the same direction.
The fact the shadows pointing in different directions, means,
that there must be 2 light sources. Studio lights!

+ So you're saying these photos are taken in a studio?

+ Exactly. Because of the shadows, this photo must be a fake.

+ You can't be serious.

+ Well, look at the second photo. Where is the sun?

+ Behind the astronaut.

+ So, if the light is behind the astronaut, why is the front of him,
not in darkness? Why? Because they used the studio lights, to shine
on the astronaut.

+ Aha.

+ Now look at the sky, in the background. What can you see?

+ Nothing.

+ Exactly.
