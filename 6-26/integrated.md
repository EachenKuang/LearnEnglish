## TPO 13

The reading and the lecture mainly talk about selling the fossils to private collectors. The
article considers the commercial usage negatively, while the professor who gives the lecture holds
an optimistic point of view. The professor falsified the opinions of the passage's one by one.

> block the public's access to them

First, the reading claims that private collectors won't allow the public to view the fossils,
which may lead to a declination in public interest in fossils. In contrast, the lecturer refuses
such idea by stating that selling fossils actually gives the schools or libraries access to obtain
them. This actually helps people to get even closer to fossils.

> will disable the scientists to obtain the most [significant/essential] fossils,
> thus making them unaware of the crucial and extinct organism.

Second, the article says that scientists might lose access to the fossils, thus it's less possible
to discover more extinct organisms. This opinion is disproved by the professor by pointing out
that all fossils are factually checked by scientists first and then put into sale, because their
actual value should be evaluated before selling. So the reading's point of view doesn't make any
sense.

<!-- Finally, the passage claims that the untrained collectors don't know how to properly treat those -->
<!-- fossils. They might destroy relevant scientific proof. The lecture states that this is actually not -->
<!-- a very serious problem. Just because the fossils might be broken doesn't mean they become -->
<!-- valueless. To be honest, the more old fossils are consumed, the more new fossils will be -->
<!-- discovered.finding but breaking the fossils is much better than simply leave them alone. -->
