The reading and the lecture mainly talk about the using fossil commercially(like selling them to
private collectors). Both of them come up with three points. The article consider the commercial
usage pessimistically, while the professor who gives the lecture holds a optimistic point of view.
The professor falsified the opinion of the passage's one by one.

First, the reading claims that private collectors won't allow the public to view the fossils,
which may lead to a declination in public interest in fossils. In contrast, the lecturer disagrees
such idea by stating that selling fossils actually give the schools, scientists, museums, or even
some individuals interested in fossils. This actually helps people to get closer to fossils.

Second, the article says that scientists might lose access to the fossils, thus it's less possible
to discover more extincted life forms. This opinion is disprooved by the professor by pointing out
that all fossils are factually checked by scientists first and then put into sale, because their
actual value should be evaluated before selling. So the reading's point of view doesn't make any
sense.

Finally, the passage's claims that the untrained collectors don't know how to properly keep those
fossils. They might destroy some parts of them. The lecture states that this is actually not a
very serious problem. Just because the fossils might be broken doesn't mean they become valueless.
To be honest, the more consuming, the more discoveries. finding but breaking the fossils is much
better than simply leave them alone.
