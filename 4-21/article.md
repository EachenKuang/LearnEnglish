## 正文

There's a large amount of contents on the web to satisfy different taste in this information-explosion society, which makes communications easier, but also some harmful stuffs spread more quickly.
TV series are a part of it, it's a way to illustrate the author's thought.
Every coin has two sides, as far as I'm concerned, this tendency seem to be beneficial in some people who can distinguish good things to learn from and bad things to avoid, but for immature teenagers who have no idea about what to imitate.
My reasons are as follows.

On one hand, some teenagers spends too much time watching TV series, which takes the time that was used for study.
people in their teens are supposed to gain as much positive knowledge as they can, which TV series rarely can give you.
Your brain is mostly active in your youth, which is best for learning, thinking, talking and, most importantly, listening from experienced experts.
This is exactly teenagers should do, but watching those characters talking and arguing about meaningless stuffs.

On the other hand, the topics many TV series talks about are too difficult to understand, which in some certain cases, makes it misleading.
For instance, films about wars and battles always have scenes about killing people.
The author probably want to tell you how did the peaceful world come from, but different people make different comprehension.
This is why these films are considered misleading, immature people may imitate from the dangerous actions, causing something unexpected.
They might go astray, embark on the criminal road.
No one expect that!

Last, but not least is that old habits die hard, once you become a coach potato, getting used to watching TV all the time, you'll be too lazy to work, for the TV is too tempting to you.
You'll become unsociable, isolated, and being alienated by people around you.
All your social abilities will be deprived.

From that we can strike a conclusion that there's no good for teenagers to watch those TV series, for both physical and mental health considered.
