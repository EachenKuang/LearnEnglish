Secondly, movies made in our own countries are closer to our daily life, and they're easier to understand. It's really
common that the movies use some allusions which are famous in that specific country or do some language-dependent
wordplays, making the films harder for the foreigners to catch the point. Like the film 'Dt. Strange', when Dt. Strange
is introducing himself, he said his name is 'Strange'. This leads to a misunderstand by others that the word 'strange'
is a adjective to him, instead of his name. Only the ones who speaks English can understand why his name is misleading.
