Recently, their's some people saying that the government should spend more money on public services rather than arts.
And I have to say, I'm totally agreed with them.

I'm a science student, who consider science more important than art.

When we talk about arts, we talk about **culture**, **civilization**, etc. But do these stuffs really worth?
People think that it's important to protect, spread the so-called art, and spend countless money on it,
building museums, libraries for it.

But does the **art** deserve it?

I do not agree.

As far as I'm concerned, there is **real art**, literally. But in most cases we see, are fake arts.

They're just created by some people who're too lazy to study, to learn, to do sports, or even composing real arts.
But they still have to live, so they simply create something and say,

> This is art. Only worthy people know it's value.<br/>

And it's a pity that most people consider it as truth. **They want to be treated as worthy people**.
If a lie repeat again and again, people will believe it.

I acknowledge, there is real art. But they're too far from us.

That's why I'm for the idea mentioned in the beginning of this article.

So in conclusion, it's better for the government to spend more money on public services,
instead of wasting it on fake art.
