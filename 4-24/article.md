There's a large amount of contents on the web to satisfy different tastes in this information-explosion society,
which makes communications easier, but this also accompany with some harmful effects.
TV series are a part of it, it's a way to illustrate the author's thought.
Every coin has two sides, as far as I'm concerned,
this tendency seems to be beneficial for some people who can distinguish right from wrong,
but not for immature teenagers who have no idea about right and wrong.
My reasons are as follows.

On one hand, some teenagers spend too much time watching TV series,
which takes the time that should be used for study.
People in their teens are supposed to gain as much positive knowledge as they can,
which they could rarely learn from TV series.
Human's brains are mostly active in their youth, which means that this is the best time for learning, thinking,
talking and, most importantly, listening from experienced experts,
but not wasting their time on watching those characters talking and arguing about meaningless stuffs.

On the other hand, many TV series can mislead teenagers.
For instance, films about wars and battles always have scenes about killing people.
The author probably wants to call on people to cherish our peaceful life,
but immature people like teenagers may imitate from the dangerous actions, causing some unexpected results.
For instance, They might go astray, and embark on the criminal road.
No one expect that!

Last, but not least, old habits die hard, once you become a coach potato,
getting used to watching TV all the time,
you'll be too lazy to work, for the TV is so tempting to you.
You'll become isolated, and be alienated by people around you.
More seriously, all your social abilities might be deprived.

From that we can strike a conclusion that there's no good for teenagers to watch those TV series,
considering both physical and mental health.
