## Whether saving money is important

> There's a famous Chinese saying, "money can make a devil work for you".
From that we can tell the significance of money -- it's the best solution
to various kinds of problems. that's why we should save as much money as
we can when we do not have to use them immediately.

## Whether playing video games is good

> The first reason is that playing video games takes a large amount of time,
and it doesn't help us with what we're expected to do. My best friend, Leo,
was addicted to video games. Once he met an extremely interesting game
named Minecraft, he just gave up everything in order to kill more zombies
in the game. In consequence, he failed his final exam, and his parents
forbade him to play it. Now he knows what's really important -- as a student,
he should play less video games in order to do what really matters. This
incident strikes me tremendously and I realized the significance of getting away
from the video games.

## Building a factory

Actually, I do not mind if there's a factory located near my house. It has lots
of advantages, like reducing the number of jobless people and attracting
more investment and restaurants. In my uncle Victor's hometown, was no any
factory. A new factory built last year really brought him an awesome life.
I don't consider it bad to build a factory near my house.

I can't agree more with building a factory near our neighborhood. Such action
abounds with various kinds of benefit. People's life quality will be
tremendously improved. If we build a factory here, it will attract more
investment and shops as well as hotels. As for the employment, the factory can
accommodate more people thus helping solve the shabby job problem. Inhabitants'
lives will be enormously increased by such decision. Therefore, I will give my
vote to building a factory near the community.

## Whether to live on campus or not

Campus' cafeterias are more formal than the small restaurants outside of the school.
From this we can tell that campus' ones are healthier. And if you get ill for
the school cafeterias, it should pay for that, but restaurants outside don't have
the responsibility to do so.

## Chinese students should begin learning a forign language ASA they start school

It remains a big question that whether Chinese students should begin learning a
forign language as soon as they start school. I totally agree with this idea, and
my reasons are as follows.

In my case, I started learning English since kindergarten, and I've recieved a
lot of benefits from that. My parents thought that everyone should start learning
a forign language as early as possible, in order to be more sensible with
languages. Because of that, When my classmates spends time on learning English,
I can do something else -- I've already learned those knowledge points!
Many European children learns two or three languages since beginning, when they
grow up, they can speak all of these languages as well as their mother tough.

On the other hand, English as a forign language, has been an important subject
taught by school teachers for long. It's also required in the college entrance
examination. That is to say, learning English is something essensial for Chinese
students. Start learning it earlier can reduce their pressure appeared when
they go to school.

The gap between nations and nations is getting narrower and narrower, and the
difference of languages remains a big question -- it's necessary, but a large
crowed of people still speak only one language. We should solve it by advancing
the start time, this has been proved to be an effective solution to the problem.

In conclusion, learning forign languages as soon as children start school is
obviously necessary, which has been proved by the evidence listed above.

## Should government spend money on entertainment or art facilities?

Should government spend money on entertainment or art facilities has been
discussed on the web sharply online. I think it really depends, but here I'll
support entertainment.

First let's focus on the benefit. Entertainment is obviously more benefitial than
art, because of the amount of people that would like to spend time and money on
using those facilities. Governments can earn more by providing entertainment
services, which enables them to provide more. That is to say, entertainment is
prior to art.

Secondly we can discuss about people's requirements. As mentioned above, less
people need art, less people understand art. Most of them just want to have a
rest after a day's heavy work. Art doesn't fit the need, but entertainment does.

From that we can draw a conclusion -- government should spend their money on
entertainment rather than art. Although art is important, but considering all the
factors mentioned above, I'll give my vote to entertainment.
